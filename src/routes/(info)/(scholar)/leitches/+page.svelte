	of the MIT community for over fifty years. Bill and Betsy have generously donated both time and
	funds in support many MIT community programs. A long time supporter of The Technology and Culture

	ecological, and economic change, T&C aims to stimulate discussion about the ethical implications
	of scientific discovery and technological innovation. Bill and Betsy have also provided support
	for other student-oriented MIT projects, including the MIT International Development Network.

<h2 class="h2">William R. '56 and Betsy P. Leitch Professorship</h2>
<p>
	Since its inception in 2002, the financial resources to support the Simmons Resident Scholar
	program have been provided by a scholarly allowance associated with the William R. '56 and Betsy
	P. Leitch Professorship. This chair is currently held by Simmons Housemaster, Professor John M.
	Essigmann. The Simmons Hall community is indebted to the Leitch family for their generous support
	of this program. It also deeply appreciates their participation in many of the programs supported
	by their donations, including Simmons events associated with the 2009 visit by His Holiness The
	Dalai Lama.
