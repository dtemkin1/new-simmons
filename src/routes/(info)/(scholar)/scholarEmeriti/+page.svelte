<h4 class="h4">Dr. Hayden and Bianca Marcollo - Winter 2003 to Summer 2004</h4>
<p>
	Hayden and Bianca Marcollo took residence in Simmons Hall in January 2003 and were our first
	Visiting Scholars. As the inaugural Scholars, they did much to craft the structure of the current
	program. Upon arrival from Australia, they met with and leaned the needs of the MIT undergraduate
	community. They fully integrated into all social events. During Friday Visiting Scholar nights,
	they introduced the students to the products of the Australian film industry in a series of events
	that became increasingly well attended, thus providing the program with its momentum. Their
	consistency in putting on events on Friday evenings helped make the program become a routine
	event. They became amongst the most visible members the Simmons Hall community.
</p>
<p>
	Hayden received his Ph.D. in Offshore Engineering at Monash University, Australia. His stay at MIT
	was hosted by Professor Kim Vandiver in the Department of Ocean Engineering. Hayden's work is
	funded by the oil industry to improve the survivability of oil pipelines. Bianca has the
	interesting profession of Midwife. While lacking a license to practice her craft in the US, she
	helped in Simmons with programs involving women’s health and has collaborated with the relevant
	groups on campus on such programs. A central theme of the Marcollo's tenure in the program was to
	arrange trips to get students off campus, and into the local community and into other areas of New
	England.

	2004 he co-coordinated an event with Jeffery Roberts, MIT class of 2002, dealing with the
	interplay between the evolution of the Simmons community and the evolution of the architectural
	design of the building. As part of his residency, Carlo would like to work with the resident
	students and faculty to describe the "lived-in" Simmons Hall. Dr. Ratti has also collaborated with
