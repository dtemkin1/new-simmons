<p>
	In recognition of the architectural significance of Simmons Hall, we offer tours of the
	non-residential areas of the building. A tour of Simmons Hall usually takes 45 to 75 minutes,
	depending upon the interests of the tour group. The maximum tour group size is 20 people, however,
	given enough notice, Simmons may be able to arrange for additional guides to accommodate larger
	groups.
</p>

<p>
	Tours cost US$5 per person in the tour group, by exact cash or by check made out to MIT. This fee
	is sometimes waived, as is the case for members of the MIT community, MIT alums and special guests
	of MIT.
</p>

<p>
	As our tour guides are students, we may not be able to accommodate your request for a tour. For
	your best chances of receiving a tour, please email
	<a class="anchor" href="mailto:simmons-tours@mit.edu">simmons-tours@mit.edu</a>
	approximately two weeks before your requested tour date to start a conversation with our guides.
</p>

<p>
	Additionally, we are unfortunately unable to offer tours outside of the regular academic calendar,
	including during the summer (May through August) or around the holidays (December through
	January). Please take this into account when submitting a tour request. We look forward to seeing
	you!

<h2 class="h2">Reserving the Multipurpose Room</h2>
<p>
	For non-Simmons groups who wish to reserve the Multipurpose Room and do not have a current
	resident to act as a point of contact, please contact House Manager Nika Hollingsworth (<a
		class="anchor"
		href="mailto:nika_h@mit.edu">nika_h@mit.edu</a
	>) to register the event and the Reservations Chair (<a
		class="anchor"
		href="mailto:simmmons-reservations@mit.edu">simmons-reservations@mit.edu</a
	>) to confirm availability.
</p>

<p>The Multipurpose Room has a maximum capacity of 125.</p>

<p>
	Reservations must be made at least a week in advance. Additionally, they can only be made
	beginning six weeks before the semester containing the requested dates. Events that span multiple
	days require approval at a House meeting, which is held every other Sunday night during the
	semester.
</p>

<p>
	All guests will need an MIT ID or a valid photo ID to gain access to the building. An account
	number must also be provided to the House Manager so a trash fee can be applied in the event the
	space is left in a less than desirable state.
</p>
