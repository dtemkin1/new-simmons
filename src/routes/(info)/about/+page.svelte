<h2 class="h2">Simmons Government</h2>

</p>

<h2 class="h2">Graduate Resident Advisors (GRAs)</h2>
<!--
old_desc
      <p>GRAs (previously known as GRTs) foster a living environment 
      that is safe, welcoming, and inclusive of all
      community members. This responsibility includes encouraging
      personal growth, providing outlets for managing stress, and
      facilitating positive interpersonal relationships. GRAs are also
      responsible for implementing community standards, enhancing
      security, and promoting mutual respect among the residents. At
      Simmons Hall they can also be found flipping pancakes at the
      famous Simmons Hall Study Breaks and organizing floor-wide
      events.</p>
-->
<p>
	The Graduate Resident Advisor (GRA) is a live-in graduate student role designed to support and
	enhance the living experience for undergraduates at MIT. A GRA works to foster a supportive, safe,
	and positive living and learning environment for all residential students. GRAs are mentors and
	educators who encourage personal growth, provide outlets for managing stress, and facilitate
	positive interpersonal relationships. GRAs are responsible for fostering an inclusive community
	built upon shared community standards and mutual respect.
</p>

<h2 class="h2">Area Director (AD)</h2>
<p>
	<a class="anchor" href="mailto:apputnam@mit.edu">Amanda Putnam</a> is the AD assigned to Simmons Hall.
	She is responsible for providing educational programming, facilitating event planning, and working
	with the Simmons Government to promote leadership.

	Manager. The house manager is responsible for the operational aspects of the building. She oversees

<p>
	Bosco loves to see and meet students! His office is in the mailbox lounge, and is almost always
	open.
	<!-- <br />
	His hours are Monday-Friday, 8:30 am – 4:30 pm. -->
</p>

<h2 class="h2">Residential Scholars Program</h2>
<p>
	Inspired by the Report of the MIT Taskforce on Student Life and Learing, The Founders Group of
	Simmons Hall envisioned a combined residential and multi-use environment in which the
	undergraduates of MIT could interact with other members of the community. Simmons includes many
	common spaces on the first floor that are intended to welcome our colleagues from across campus
	and our neighbors from Cambridge.
</p>

<p>
	The Residential Scholars program is meant to enrich MIT with new ideas and perspectives from
	people from elsewhere who are eager to share their wealth of life experiences. The program is
	composed of faculty members on sabbatical leave from other institutions, international scholars,
	artists, industry professionals, and a limited number of MIT faculty members who have shown, by a
	history of contributions to the community, a reason to participate in this program.
</p>

<p>
	The program is based in Simmons Hall but services the entire community. The Scholars, working with
	the permanent House Team, typically run programs on Friday evenings. Since its inception in 2003,
	the financial resources to support the program primarily have been provided by the scholarly
	allowance associated with the William and Betsy Leitch Professorship<!--, which is held by John
	Essigmann, one of the Heads of House of Simmons Hall-->.
	The community is indebted to the Leitchs for their generous support of this program.
</p>

<h2 class="h2">The House Team</h2>
<p>
	The Heads of House, Area Director, House Manager, and GRAs form the House Team, which provide
	academic and personal guidance to students to help them get the most out of their time at MIT. The
	House Team fosters a living environment that is safe, welcoming, and inclusive of all community
	members. The Heads of House and Area Director may represent Simmons students on various committees
	and task forces in addition to their regular duties.
