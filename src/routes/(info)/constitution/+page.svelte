<h2 class="h2">The Constitution of Simmons Hall</h2>
<p>Last updated February 12, 2023</p>

<hr />

<p class="font-bold uppercase">Preamble</p>
<p>
	For decades at MIT, dormitory communities have been developing sophisticated systems of
	self-governance. These systems are entirely student-built and student-run, and they have received
	very little support or interference from the MIT administration. Despite or because of this (you
	be the judge), these governance systems have developed quite well.
</p>
<p>
	According to the MIT administration, Simmons Hall is intended to signal a change from the current
	standards of dorm life. Thisi is largely true. However, the governance of Simmons Hall will not be
	a change away from the self-governance model, but formalization and strengthening of it. The
	Simmons Hall governance model is intended to allow the dorm to have more independence and a
	stronger voice in the decisions that affect it. Moreover, it is intended to better define the
	relationship of Heads of House<a id="link-to-f1" href="#f1" class="anchor"><sup>1</sup></a> and
	Graduate Resident Tutors<a id="link-to-f2" href="#f2" class="anchor"><sup>2</sup></a> to the governance
	process, encouraging their participation and support but ensuring that they do not assume control over
	governance functions.
</p>
<p>
	The Simmons Hall governance model is also founded on the concept of the House as an entity that is
	more than just a building and more than simply the sum of its residents. All residents are
	supported by the House physically and socially. Reciprocally, the House requires support from all
	of its residents. This House model works on several basic principles:
</p>
<p>
	Principle 1: All residents have an implicit responsibility to the House. There is not a select
	group of people who handle all the functions of House governance and whom you can blame if dorm
	life is not what you want it to be. It is up to everyone. If you want Simmons Hall to be a good
	place, you have to get involved and make it that way. If you think Simmons Hall sucks, then
	there&#8217;s no one you can blame but yourself.
</p>
<p>
	Principle 2: There are varying levels of responsibility to choose from. You can run for an elected
	Office, or volunteer to serve on a committee, or show up to House meetings, or on the most basic
	level, have respect for the House and for your fellow residents.
</p>
<p>
	Principle 3: The House speaks for the House. When the House makes a decision, it is explicit that
	the decision was made through a democratic process that involves all House residents. There are no
	representatives who &#8220;call the shots&#8221; for everyone.
</p>
<p>
	Principle 4: If you do not like something, change it. While traditions are important to building
	culture, the House should not keep doing something simply because people did it the year before,
	and other people did it the year before that. Times keep changing and the House should keep
	thinking creatively and coming up with new ways to improve House life.
</p>
<p>
	Principle 5: House governance should be part of the educational experience for all residents.
	Students and faculty alike should feel that they learned something from being an active member of
	the House. They should also feel that they had some degree of fun and that their educational
	experience was better because they had a release from the rigor of MIT academics and research.
</p>
<p>This is the philosophy behind the governance of Simmons Hall.</p>

				Constitution of Simmons Hall
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						The purpose of the Constitution is: (a) to establish the overall model for governance of
						the House; (b) to define the roles of some of the individuals and groups who are
						involved in the governance of the House; (c) to define some of the procedures that guide
						the proper functioning of House governance.

				The House
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						The House refers to the collective residents and communities residing within the Simmons

			<li>
				House and Chair Policies
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						House and Chair Policies supplement the Constitution in guiding House governance, and
						may be created and revised continually over time.
					</li>
					<li>
						House Policies may include, but are not limited to, policies on the use of House
						facilities and House funds, rules of conduct such as quiet hours or regulations on the
						use of alcohol, policies that establish the roles and responsibilities of new House
						governance groups or positions, and policies that define or clarify House governance
						procedures.
					</li>
					<li>
						Chair Policies are determined by each current chair. These policies serve to clarify
						chairs' roles and responsibilities as assigned by the constitution. They also serve to
						inform members of the House of officers roles and responsibilities. The content of each
						chair's policies can be changed by said chair, however these changes must be announced
						at a House Meeting to take effect. It is encouraged that a chair solicit house opinion
						before changing his or her policies.

		<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
			<li>
				Introduction
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						The House makes many decisions that impact all its residents. It raises funds to use
						towards House-shared resources and events. The governance of Simmons Hall is established
						on the principle that when an issue affects all residents, every resident should have a
						voice in making a decision on that issue.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

			<li>
				House Membership
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						Every official resident of Simmons Hall is a member of the House. Each member may cast
						one vote in any House decision.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

			<li>
				Role and Responsibilities of the House
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						The House, by collective action, makes all major house-wide decisions and expresses the
						official opinion of Simmons Hall on any matter of interest to the residents of Simmons
						Hall.
					</li>
					<li>
						The House is responsible for: (a) establishing House and Chair Policies, and making
						changes to standing House Policies and the Constitution; (b) allocating House funds to
						be used towards House-shared resources and events; (c) discussing and deciding upon any
						issue of relevance to Simmons Hall or to MIT at large; (d) approving any resolution
						expressing the official opinion of the residents of Simmons Hall on any such issue (e)
						electing House Officers to carry out the will of the House.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

			<li>
				House Procedures
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						All official business of the House is discussed at meetings that are open and announced
						to all members of the House and occur at least once within every two-week period during
						spring and fall semesters that MIT classes are in session. House Officer meetings shall
						be held at least a half an hour before general House meetings.
					</li>
					<li>
						Any House member may propose an item to be discussed or decided upon by the House by
						submitting a proposal to the Chair of the House, who must place that item on the agenda
						of the next House meeting if the agenda for that meeting has not been set.
					</li>
					<li>
						For all proposals brought before the House, four actions are available to the House:
						Approve, Reject, Table, and Move-to-Full-Forum. The Chair of the House should remind
						participants at the start of each semester that these options are available. Voting may
						take place during meetings of the House or by ballot in the case of Move-to-Full-Forum.
						No item may be voted upon until after it has been discussed at a House meeting.
					</li>
					<li>
						At least one author of the proposal must be present to advocate for it. Should no author
						be present, the proposal shall be Tabled automatically, unless an author has presented
						the House Chair an alternative advocate for the proposal in advance. Would the same
						proposal be automatically tabled in this manner for the third consecutive time, it will
						instead be automatically rejected to avoid cluttering the agenda with orphaned
						proposals.
					</li>
					<li>
						During debate on a proposal, motions may be raised. After a member of the House states
						intention to raise a motion, another member must second the motion in order for it to
						have any effect (i.e. "be raised").
					</li>
					<li>
						Proposals may be approved during a House meeting following a motion to vote. Once
						seconded, the House chair should direct and tally a vote, unless a motion to object is
						raised and seconded. In such cases, the House should return to debate on the proposal.
						Proposals are approved by a majority vote yes, with the exception that proposals for
						Constitutional Amendments require a two-thirds majority vote for approval.
					</li>
					<li>
						Proposals may be approved during a House meeting following a motion to vote. Once
						seconded, the House chair should direct and tally a vote, unless a motion to object is
						raised and seconded; in such cases, the House should return to debate on the proposal.
						At the conclusion of every such vote, the House Chair must impose an increase in speed
						of the meeting at his/her discretion, ranging from one (1) to five (5) percent.
						Proposals are approved by a majority vote yes, with the exception that proposals for
						Constitutional Amendments require a two-thirds majority vote for approval.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the case where those assembled feel they are unanimously in favor of approving the
						proposal, a motion to white-ballot can be used. When a motion to white-ballot is raised,
						the House chair should ask those assembled if any are opposed. If any member of the
						House present is opposed, then the motion fails and the House returns to Debate. Once a
						motion to white-ballot fails for a particular measure, no further motions to
						white-ballot may be raised for that measure. A motion to white-ballot may not be used to
						approve a constitutional amendment or a proposal greater than $300.
					</li>
					<li>
						A motion to force-vote may be used to counter the case when a vote cannot be held due to
						frivolous objections. Once raised in the course of normal debate, a motion to force-vote
						causes the House Chair to poll the support for a vote of those assembled. This vote
						cannot be interrupted by a motion to object or any other motion except for the explicit
						exceptions outlined in 2.4.10 and 2.4.12. If the force-vote passes with majority support
						then the meeting should proceed as if a motion to vote had been raised, with the
						exception that no motions, including motions to object, may interrupt the vote. For each
						proposal, no more than one motion to force-vote may be raised in any five minute period.
					</li>
					<li>
						Proposals are moved-to-full-forum by a greater than one-third vote yes. A motion to
						move-to-full-forum takes precedence over a motion to approve but a motion to object can
						still return the House to debate. When a proposal is moved-to-full-forum, the Secretary
						should create a description of the issue of contention with input from one or more
						proponents and opponents. The Secretary would then publicly post the description and
						issue a full house ballot on the issue to be concluded before the next house meeting.
						The results of this vote would be final.
					</li>
					<li>
						A motion to force-move-to-full-forum works like to a motion to force-vote with two
						exceptions. First it requires only one-third support to proceed and second an
						uninterrupted motion to move-to-full-forum, not a motion to vote, is the result. For
						each proposal, no more than one such motion may be raised in any five minute period. A
						motion to force-move-to-full-forum takes precedence over a motion to force-vote.
					</li>
					<li>
						Proposals are tabled by a majority vote. A motion to table takes precedence over a
						motion to move-to-full-forum and a motion to approve but a motion to object can still
						return the House to debate. When a proposal is tabled, it is moved to the next house
						meeting.
					</li>
					<li>
						A motion to force-table entails an immediate and uninterrupted vote on house support for
						said motion. Should a majority agree with the motion, then an uninterrupted motion to
						table should proceed. For each proposal, no more than one such motion may be raised in
						any five minute period. A motion to force-table takes precedence over a motion to
						force-move-to-full-forum and a motion to force-vote.
					</li>
					<li>
						For all the motions above, the fraction of votes required is to be taken as a fraction
						of those electing to vote on the motion. Any members of the House who are not present or
						who choose to abstain shall not be included in the count of the total number of votes.
					</li>
					<li>
						A quorum of 10 voting members is required to hold a house meeting. Otherwise all
						proposals are tabled to the following house meeting.
					</li>

				Elections
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						Only undergraduate members of the House are eligible to serve as officers. No individual
						may hold more than one office simultaneously, except in cases where an office remains
						unfilled for an extended length of time.
					</li>
					<li>
						All elections must be open to all members of the House, whether or not they are able to
						attend House meetings.
					</li>
					<li>
						The election process is overseen by the Elections Organizer. By default, the Elections
						Organizer is the Chair of the House. However, if the Chair intends to be a candidate in
						the election or otherwise wishes not to be Elections Organizer, the Chair must select
						another undergraduate member of the House (who must not intend to be a candidate) to be
						the Elections Organizer. This selection must be approved by a simple majority vote of
						the House. The selection of Elections Organizer must occur before the beginning of
						nominations. The Elections Organizer cannot be nominated to be a candidate. The
						Elections Organizer hears all complaints related to the fairness of the election
						procedure.
					</li>
					<li>
						Nominations for officer positions will occur during the week preceding the elections
						House meeting. A nominee will be placed on the ballot if their name is mentioned. People
						can nominate themselves and nominate multiple times. One can be nominated by proxy. The
						Chair must nominate anyone who notified him/her by two days before the House meeting.
					</li>
					<li>
						During the week before the announced election meeting and the final meeting of the term,
						there is a special election meeting. During this meeting, all candidates will be given
						three minutes to present their platform and one minute to answer questions. A further
						several minutes will be dedicated to questioning any/all of the candidates for a
						particular office. Proxies may read the platform of missing candidates, but may not take
						part in the question answering sessions.
					</li>
					<li>
						The voting period is the period after the elections meeting and before the agenda closes
						for the next regularly scheduled house meeting. The winner of each election is
						determined using instant runoff voting. In the case of a tie between two individuals for
						a position that can be held by two people, they may chose to serve as co-chairs or to
						hold a runoff election.
					</li>
					<li>
						New officers take office during the first meeting of the spring term. During the
						transition period (the time between election results and the first spring House
						meeting), outgoing officers have the responsibility of training the incoming officers
						and handing over turnover files. Outgoing officers also have the responsibility of
						helping to run the first meeting of the spring term.
					</li>
					<li>
						An office becomes vacant when the individual holding that office resigns or is no longer
						an official resident of Simmons Hall. An Officer may resign by informing the Chair of
						the House of one’s resignation, or the Chair of the House may assume that an officer has
						resigned if that officer fails to communicate with the House or otherwise fails to
						undertake the responsibilities of that office.
					</li>
					<li>
						If a House Officer position, other than one specified in article II.5.7, becomes vacant
						mid-term, the resigning officer should be reminded of his/her duty to train the
						replacement. The Chair of the House should notify the House that the spot has become
						vacant and that they may demonstrate interest within the week. At the end of the week,
						one of two outcomes has occurred: (a) 1 or 0 people have contacted the chair. In this
						case, the chair is permitted to appoint said person (if one is found) to the office in
						question. The Chair must ratify the selection at the next House meeting with a simple
						majority vote; (b) 2 or more people have contacted the chair. In this case, the chair
						(with the help of other officers) must administer a one-week mid-term election for the
						House to select between the candidates. Additionally, if the end of the one-week special
						election would fall within one month of the end of a regular election, then the House
						Chair may exercise discretion in deciding whether to run a vote / appoint directly /
						wait for the main election.
					</li>
					<li>
						The previous section, Article 5 Section 1 Item 8, does not apply to the instance in
						which the Secretary chooses to assume the role of House Chair permanently.

						Provisionally elected officers take office immediately upon election and fill the vacant
						office until the time of the next regular election.

				Recall Elections

						neglecting the responsibilities of that office; (b) the current holder of the Office is
						abusing the authority granted to that office; (c) the current holder of the Office is
						not acting in the interest of the House. A proposal of a Recall Election must include an
						explanation that addresses at least one of these three points. The proposal is placed on
						the agenda at the discretion of the House Chair, given that it includes this
						explanation.
					</li>
					<li>
						A proposal of a Recall Election is discussed and voted upon in the same manner as is any
						other item of House business.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the Chair of the House is the object of the Recall Election, the Secretary of the
						House assumes the responsibilities of the Chair for all business relating to the Recall
						Election.
					</li>
					<li>
						If a Recall Election is approved by a House vote, the Officer in question holds the
						position until it is filled according to the Special Elections procedures outlined in
						Section IV.1.9-11.

				Impeachment
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						Any member or group of members of the House may propose an Article of Impeachment
						against an officer, if that member or group feels that: (a) the officer is neglecting
						the responsibilities of that office; (b) the officer is abusing the authority granted to
						that office; (c) the Officer is not acting in the interest of the House. A proposed
						Article of Impeachment must include an explanation that addresses at least one of these
						three points.
					</li>
					<li>
						A proposed Article of Impeachment is placed on the House agenda, discussed, and voted
						upon in the same manner as is any other item of House business.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the Chair of the House is the object of the Article of Impeachment, the Secretary of
						the House assumes the responsibilities of the Chair for all business relating to the
						Article of Impeachment.
					</li>
					<li>
						If an Article of Impeachment is approved by a House vote, the Chair of the House holds a
						hearing open to all members of the House. The proponent of the Article of Impeachment,
						the object of the Article of Impeachment, and the Chair are given the opportunity to
						speak at this hearing, and may invite witnesses to speak on their behalf, but any
						witness may be dismissed by the Chair of the House on the grounds of irrelevance. No
						other individuals are allowed to speak at this hearing.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Chair of the House may decide, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, to
						remove an individual from office if and only if: (a) the information presented in the
						Article of Impeachment is truthful in content; and (b) the Article of Impeachment
						sufficiently explains why the impeached individual should be removed from office. After
						deliberation, the Chair presents the decision, along with a written explanation, to the
						House.
					</li>
					<li>
						An office that is unoccupied as the result of impeachment proceedings is then treated in
						the same manner as any other vacancy, except that the removed officer is no longer
						eligible to hold that office.

				Live-In House Support Positions

						These include Head of Houses and Graduate Resident Advisors (GRAs), Visiting Scholars,
						and the Assistant Director / Area Director<a id="link-to-f3" href="#f3" class="anchor"
							><sup>3</sup></a
						> among others. Along with the House Manager and staff, these individuals collectively form
						a House Support Team, with the Head of Houses serving as its head, that operates independently
						of the House government but must remain in contact with the House government in order to
						ensure a mutually supportive working relationship.
					</li>
					<li>
						Head of Houses, GRAs, and any other individuals who are specially selected by MIT to
						live in Simmons Hall are all considered Members of the House, but do not have any
						official standing within the House, nor do they have any official responsibilities to
						the House. Nonetheless, they are encouraged to participate in all activities of the
						House, and to offer their support where the House would benefit from the specialized
						assistance they may be able to provide.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

			<li>
				The Head of House Role
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						The Simmons Hall Head of House team consists of the Heads of House and Associate Heads
						of House, who are faculty members living with their families in Simmons Hall. The Heads
						of House and Associate Heads of House are appointed to their positions by the Office of
						the Dean for Student Life. They are expected to integrate fully into Simmons and to
						support the entire dorm socially and intellectually.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Head of House role in Simmons falls into four areas: (a) They hold frequent social
						events, and participate actively in the social events held by House residents, in order
						to get to know as many undergraduates as possible; (b) they help residents deal with
						problems, ranging from inter-personal or inter-group issues to those of a highly
						personal and individual nature; (c) they supervise the Graduate Resident Advisors; (d)
						they report to the rest of the MIT faculty and to the MIT administration.
					</li>
					<li>
						When a new Head of House or Associate Head of House must be selected, a committee of
						House Officers is formed to review candidates and make recommendations to the Dean for
						Student Life.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

			<li>
				The Graduate Resident Advisor Role
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						Graduate Resident Advisors are MIT graduate students hired by the Office of the Dean for
						Student Life to live in Simmons Hall, sometimes along with partners or families. They
						are expected to integrate fully into the dorm and to provide support to a specific set
						of residents living in a particular area of the building.
					</li>
					<li>
						The GRA role in the House falls into four areas: (a) They serve as advisors and mentors
						to residents, particularly those living within their area; (b) they respond to crises
						and conflicts that occur within the dorm, relying on their training and judgment; (c)
						they serve as advocates for the interests of students, as liaisons between students and
						Heads of House, and sometimes as liaisons between students and the administration; (d)
						they serve as community facilitators, encouraging interaction and providing recreational
						opportunities for residents, particularly those living within their area.
					</li>
					<li>
						The GRA role in the dorm expressly excludes any disciplinary component. Only the Heads
						of House may officially recommend disciplinary action against a resident of Simmons
						Hall.
					</li>
					<li>
						When new GRAs must be hired to fill open positions in Simmons Hall, a House committee of
						all interested Simmons residents and the Head of House team is formed to review all
						candidates and provide a list of recommended candidates to the Office of the Dean for
						Student Life.

				Other Special Live-In Positions
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">

						Other individuals who are selected to live in Simmons Hall may include Visiting Scholars
						and their families, Residential Life Associates, or possibly others to be defined in the
						future.
					</li>
					<li>
						Individuals specially selected by an MIT authority to live in Simmons Hall, while
						Members of the House, are not required to have any special responsibilities to the
						House. However, the House may establish House Policies regarding the roles these
						individuals are expected to play in the House. Live-in roles as defined by the House
						must complement, and must not contradict, the roles as defined by the MIT authority
						responsible for appointing or hiring the individuals.

				Non-Live-In House Support Positions
				<ol class="list-decimal mx-4 px-4 py-2">
					<li>
						Individuals who play significant support roles within the Simmons Hall community but are
						not residents of Simmons Hall may include the House Manager, staff serving under the
						House Manager, the dining hall staff, and others. These individuals are not considered
						Members of the House, nor do they have any official standing with respect to the House,
						nor do they have any official responsibilities to the House. Nonetheless, the House,
						through its officers, is encouraged to communicate them, and ask for their support in
