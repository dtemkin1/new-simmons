				The Simmons DB is set up to use <a
					class="font-bold anchor"
					href="https://ist.mit.edu/touchstone"
					>Touchstone Authentication
				</a>
				to authenticate logins, but you can also set up the system to let you
				<a class="anchor" href="{base}/sds/users/password">log in with a password</a> as an alternative.
				(Note, however, that you need to be already logged in in order to set up your password.)

			<!-- <p>
				A new feature of the Simmons DB is the ability to login using your MIT Kerberos (email)
				username and password. To do this, go to the
